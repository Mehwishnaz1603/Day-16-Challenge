//Question 48: Combining Arrays with Spread Operator: Suppose you're comparing prices of
//two different sets of laptops. Use the spread operator to combine these arrays into a 
//single array sorted in ascending order, then log the result.
let price1 = [20000, 30000]
let price2 = [25000, 50000]
let combine = [...price1, ...price2].sort((a, b) => a - b)
console.log(combine);

//Question 46: Enhanced Laptop Object: Construct an object for a laptop including properties 
//make, model, year, and a method describe() that logs a sentence about the laptop.

console.log(`The laptop is a ${this.year}, ${this.make}, ${this.model}.`);}}
laptop.describe()

//Question 47: Advanced Array Destructuring: Given an array of objects representingdifferent
//laptops, each with properties make, model, and year, use array destructuring to assign the 
//first and second laptops to variables. Then, log these variables.
//laptops to variables. Then, log these variables.
